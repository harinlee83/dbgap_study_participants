&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background Information:&lt;/b&gt; Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is an age-related, intraocular pressure (IOP)-dependent  progressive optic neuropathy that ultimately leads to irreversible blindness. Vision loss from POAG is a condition  of public health significance. Current evidence suggests that POAG is a polygenetic disease modified by environmental  influences. Despite the fact that a positive family history of disease is an important risk factor for POAG, conventional  linkage and candidate gene approaches have revealed less than 5% of the genetic component of the disease.  Furthermore,  there is no consensus on environment risk factors for POAG.  Elevated IOP is the only modifiable risk factor for POAG;  yet, lowering IOP slows, but does not halt the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Objectives:&lt;/b&gt; The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the pathogenesis of POAG so that cost-effective  disease detection and primary prevention strategies can be implemented.  The primary aim of the &lt;b&gt;Glau&lt;/b&gt;coma &lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;ene  &lt;b&gt;En&lt;/b&gt;vironment Initiative (GLAUGEN), funded by the Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), is to discover genetic  loci associated with POAG. The secondary aim of GLAUGEN, funded by NHGRI and the National Eye Institute, is to discover gene  environment interactions in POAG.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods and study populations:&lt;/b&gt; For this study, we have assembled cases and controls from three studies: the Nurses&amp;#39;  Health Study (&lt;b&gt;NHS&lt;/b&gt;), the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (&lt;b&gt;HPFS&lt;/b&gt;) and the Genetic Etiologies of POAG (&lt;b&gt;GEP&lt;/b&gt;)  project based at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI). This case-control group includes 1057 unrelated cases  and 1272 controls. Members of the NHS and HPFS also have repeated environmental exposure data collected prior to a diagnosis  of POAG.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;NHS - The Nurses Health Study started in 1976 under the direction of Dr. Frank E. Speizer. With funding from the NIH,  registered nurses from 11 US states were invited to complete a detailed questionnaire regarding lifestyle and health biennially.   Initially, 121,000 women responded to the baseline questionnaire.  Currently, Dr. Susan Hankinson serves  as the program director for the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;HPFS - The Health Professionals Follow-up Study began in 1986 under the direction of Drs. Walter Willett and Meir Stampfer.  Under the auspices of the NIH, they enlisted 51,529 male health professionals from throughout the US to complete similarly  designed biennial questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1990, questions regarding ocular health were added to biennial questionaires completed by health professionals  participating in the NHS and HPFS. This allowed us to formulate (PI: S. Hankinson; NEI) and maintain (PI: L. Pasquale; NEI)  a cohort at risk for POAG derived from the respective general cohorts who were under ophthalmic care. We then developed a  definition of POAG that allowed us to identify cases from a population that was geographically dispersed. The centerpiece of  this definition is the presence of reproducible visual field loss consistent with nerve fiber layer (NFL) dropout (the NFL  contains the axons that comprise the optic nerve) on reliable tests. Reproducible visual field loss occurred in the context  of anterior segment findings that did not suggest a secondary cause of elevated IOP and posterior segment findings that did  not suggest a secondary cause of visual field loss. We selected controls from the cohort at risk for POAG on the basis of  age, gender and time period when cases were identified.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;GEP - The Genetic Etiologies of POAG was initiated in 1996 with funding from the National Eye Institute under the  direction of Dr. Janey Wiggs.  The purpose of this work was to discover novel genetic loci associated with POAG.  In the  GEP, cases were derived predominantly from the Glaucoma Service at MEEI. The majority of cases had an examination by a  glaucoma specialist and met the definition for POAG used in NHS and HPFS. Cases with only one reliable visual field  consistent with NFL dropout were included if there was a cup-disc ratio of 0.7 or more.  The majority of controls were  patients who presented to the MEEI comprehensive ophthalmology service for routine eye examination or from spouses  of MEEI patients with secondary forms of glaucoma.  Other controls were identified from regional glaucoma screenings  held throughout Massachusetts. Members of GEP have detailed ocular phenotype data but limited information on  environmental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This study is part of the Gene Environment Association Studies initiative   (GENEVA, &lt;a href="http://www.genevastudy.org" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.genevastudy.org&lt;/a&gt;) funded by the trans-NIH Genes,   Environment, and Health Initiative (GEI). The overarching goal is to identify novel genetic factors that contribute to   primary open-angle glaucoma through large-scale genome-wide association studies of three well-characterized cohorts of cases   and controls, some in matched pairs. Genotyping was performed at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, a GENEVA genotyping   center. Data cleaning and harmonization were performed at the GEI-funded GENEVA Coordinating Center at the   University of Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
 </Description><StudyHistory>
&lt;p&gt;The NHS and HPFS were initiated in 1976 and 1986 respectively, when 121,000 registered nurses participated  and 51,529 male health professionals completed detailed questionnaires about lifestyle and general health.  Questionnaires have been repeated every year and the content of these questionnaires can be found at the following websites:  &lt;a href="http://www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs" target="_blank"&gt;www.channing.harvard.edu/nhs&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/hpfs_qx.htm" target="_blank"&gt;www.hsph.harvard.edu/hpfs/hpfs_qx.htm&lt;/a&gt;.  Follow-up has  been approximately 85% of the total person time of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1990, questions regarding ocular health were added to the biennial questionnaires in both the NHS and HPFS cohort.  In 1996,  under the direction of Dr. Susan Hankinson, Dr. Jae Hee Kang formed the cohort at risk for POAG.  In 2004, Dr. Pasquale,  capitalizing on DNA samples collected from 1990 through 2004, studied the relation between candidate gene-environment  interactions in POAG.  This provided an opportunity to expand the cohort at risk for POAG and to form a case-control  group nested within that cohort. This nested case-control group served as the basis for the NHS/HPFS portion of this  case-control group.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1996, Dr. Janey Wiggs began her study of the genetic determinants of POAG. In 2000, she published a low-density  genome wide scan for POAG, a study that demonstrated that POAG is a polygenetic disease.  Subsequent funding allowed for the   expansion of her clinic-based repository, which served as the basis for the GEP component of this case-control cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
