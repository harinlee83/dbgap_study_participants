Use of the WHI data to conduct non-genetic research is prohibited. WHI data may not be used to investigate individual pedigree structures, individual participant genotypes, perceptions of racial/ethnic identity, variables that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or group, or issues such as non-maternity. Users acknowledge that American Indian participants were self-identified and were primarily dwelling in urban areas and are not representative of the diverse American Indian population across the United States. Users agree not to use the data to infer tribal status or affiliation.
