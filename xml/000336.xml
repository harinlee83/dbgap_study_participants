&lt;p&gt;Three genetic loci for lung cancer risk have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but inherited  susceptibility to specific histologic types of lung cancer is not well established. We conducted a GWAS of lung cancer  and its major histologic types genotyping 515,922 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5,739 incident lung cancer cases  and 5,848 controls from one population-based case-control study and three cohort studies. Results were combined with  summary data from 10 additional studies for a total of 13,300 cases and 19,666 controls of European descent.  Four studies  also provided histology data for replication resulting in 3,333 adenocarcinomas (AD), 2,589 squamous cell carcinomas (SQ),  and 1,418 small cell carcinomas (SC).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In analyses by histology, rs2736100 (&lt;i&gt;TERT&lt;/i&gt;) on chromosome 5p15.33, was associated with risk of adenocarcinoma  (OR=1.23, 95%CI=1.13-1.33, P=3.02x10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;), but not other histologic types (OR=1.01, P=0.84, and OR=1.00, P=0.93, for SQ  and SC, respectively). This finding was confirmed in each replication study and overall meta-analysis  (OR=1.24, 95%CI=1.17-1.31, P=3.74x10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; for AD and OR=0.99, P=0.69 and OR=0.97, P=0.48, for SQ and SC, respectively).  Other previously reported association signals on 15q25 and 6p21 were also refined, but no additional loci reached genome-wide  significance. In conclusion, a lung cancer GWAS identified a distinct hereditary contribution to adenocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: The lung study dataset to be released to dbGaP and caBIG excludes 47 individuals from the PLCO cohort who consented  to participate only in cancer research projects and 22 individuals because of updated QC. Thus, the released dataset is derived  from 11517 subjects, 5699 cases and 5818 controls. After the updated QC, the dataset to be released to dbGaP and caBIG  includes 506062 SNPs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 </Description><StudyHistory>
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a GWAS in 5739 lung cancer cases and 5848 controls (National Cancer Institute [NCI] GWAS) to search for overall  susceptibility variants and variants associated with specific histologic types and smoking status. We also conducted a  meta-analysis of the NCI GWAS with summary data from ten additional studies, for a total of 13,300 primary lung cancer  cases and 19,666 controls, all of European descent. Four of the ten studies provided information on histology for  replication analyses; 3333 AD, 2589 SQ, and 1418 SC cases were analyzed overall.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The 11,587 subjects in the NCI GWAS were drawn from one population-based case-control study and three cohort studies;  specifically: the Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology (EAGLE), a population-based case-control study  including 2100 primary lung cancer cases and 2120 healthy controls enrolled in Italy between 2002 and 2005; the  Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC), a randomized primary prevention trial  including 29,133 male smokers enrolled in Finland between 1985 and 1993; the Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovary Screening Trial (PLCO),  a randomized trial including 150,000 individuals enrolled in ten U.S. study centers between 1992 and 2001; and the  Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II), including over 183,000 subjects enrolled by the  American Cancer Society between 1992 and 2001 across all U.S. states. Analyses stratified by histology in the  NCI GWAS included 1730 AD cases, 1400 SQ cases, 678 SC cases, and groups of other histological types or of mixed histologies.  These studies were approved by the individual institutional review boards of each location, and each subject gave his or  her informed consent for participation. In the PLCO study, 47 individuals gave permission to participate only in studies  involving lung cancer, and thus have been excluded from the dataset released on dbGaP and caBIG.&lt;/p&gt;
