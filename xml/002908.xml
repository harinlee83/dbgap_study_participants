The HCHS/SOL dbGaP data is intended to promote the discovery of specific genetic loci acting as risk (or protective) factors for health-related traits. Use of these data to conduct non-genetic research is prohibited. The data may not be used to investigate individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying study participants. Investigation of relatedness among individuals, and of genomic composition in terms of genetic ancestry, may be used as tools to detect and characterize genetic risk factors for health-related traits.
