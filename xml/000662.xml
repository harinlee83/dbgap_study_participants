Participants in this formative research project completed the appropriate NCS Vanguard Study Informed Consent form as well as an additional formative research Study Specific Consent form. 

The current NCS consent form discusses data sharing for information and samples and allows for genetic and other data and samples to be shared with outside researchers for future research for purposes consistent with the goals of the NCS which are to obtain information about child and maternal health and disease.  Most generally, the goal of the Study is to &#8220;learn more about how our physical environment, social environment, and family environment affect children&#8217;s health, growth, and development while they are young and when they become adults.&#8221;  Additionally, the NCS Vanguard Study informed consent form mentions that information about participants&#8217; communities, race and ethnicity will be shared with approved researchers and that &#8220;there is a possibility that specific Study findings will be associated with particular racial and ethnic groups.&#8221; 

Discussion of the Vanguard Study&#8217;s approach to data sharing is in multiple places in the informed consent form. The NCS current informed consent form (for pregnant women) at this time (v20110324) is attached as Appendix B.  
According to the terms of these consents, this data may be used for health-related research focused on child health and development from childhood into adulthood and maternal health.
Requesters and Approved Users agree to notify the NICHD Data Access Committee and the NCS Incident Response Team (NCSIncidentResponse@nih.gov) of any unauthorized data sharing, breaches of data security, or inadvertent data releases that may compromise data confidentiality within 24 hours of when the incident is identified. The NCS Incident Response Team Report Form is attached in Appendix C.  As permitted by law, notifications should include the known information regarding the incident and a general description of the activities or process in place to fully define and remediate the situation. Within 3 business days of the NICHD Data Access Committee notification, the Requester, through the Approved User and the Institutional Signing Official, agree to submit to the NICHD Data Access Committee a more detailed written report including the date and nature of the event, actions taken or to be taken to remediate the issue(s), and plans or processes developed to prevent further problems, including specific information on timelines anticipated for action.

All notifications and written reports of data security incidents should be sent to:
NICHD Data Access Committee: HD-DAC@mail.nih.gov AND the NCS Incident Response Team (NCSIncidentResponse@nih.gov).  [Mark as: URGENT Email] [See Term 6]

The progress report should cite work done that relates specifically to this dataset [National Children&#8217;s Study Vanguard Formative Research Project] and not just a generic report for a series of datasets that may also have been requested.
