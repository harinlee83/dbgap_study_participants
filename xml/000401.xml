Use of the Framingham data deposited in dbGaP is restricted to research on: genotype-phenotype associations; molecular phenotype (e.g., gene expression; microRNA)-phenotype associations; and proteomics/metabolomics-phenotype associations.  All other phenotype-only analyses are prohibited (note: investigators may request data for such phenotype-only analyses through NHLBI&#8217;s BioLINCC).  Additionally, the Framingham data may not be used to: 
o Investigate individual pedigree structures or individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying individuals or families; or explore issues such as non-maternity or non-paternity.
o Investigate topics that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or group.
o Assess outcomes that are not related to health or disease conditions (note: methodological research that will serve as a prelude to health or disease research is permitted).
Data users are responsible for ensuring that all uses of the data are consistent with federal, state, and local laws and any relevant institutional policies, and that the data are always maintained in a secured fashion. Data users will be required to obtain IRB approval for their projects from their respective institutions. Only full or expedited approvals are acceptable, and an ANNUAL IRB review is required base on the informed consents from the submitting institution. It is anticipated that, at least in some cases, the FHS data will be updated with additional information and will be so identified by an appropriate version number. Data use is limited by consent groups to the following two groups: a) Health/Medical/Biomedical and related Methods and b) Health/Medical/Biomedical and related Methods for Non-Profit Use Only.

Additionally, the Framingham data may not be used

non-paternity.
o Investigate topics that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or group.

Use of the Framingham data deposited in dbGaP is restricted to research on: genotype-phenotype associations; molecular phenotype (e.g., gene expression; microRNA)-phenotype associations; and proteomics/metabolomics-phenotype associations.  All other phenotype-only analyses are prohibited (note: investigators may request data for such phenotype-only analyses through NHLBI&#8217;s BioLINCC).  Additionally, the Framingham data may not be used to: 
o Investigate individual pedigree structures or individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying individuals or families; or explore issues such as non-maternity or non-paternity.
o Investigate topics that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or group.
o Assess outcomes that are not related to health or disease conditions (note: methodological research that will serve as a prelude to health or disease research is permitted).
Data users are responsible for ensuring that all uses of the data are consistent with federal, state, and local laws and any relevant institutional policies, and that the data are always maintained in a secured fashion. Data users will be required to obtain IRB approval for their projects from their respective institutions (please note that only full or expedited approvals will be accepted). It is anticipated that, at least in some cases, the FHS data will be updated with additional information and will be so identified by an appropriate version number. Data use is limited by consent groups to the following two groups: a) Health/Medical/Biomedical and related Methods and b) Health/Medical/Biomedical and related Methods for Non-Profit Use Only.

</Use-Restriction></ConsentGroup><ConsentGroup uid="910" CGType="cg_class_other" title="Exchange Area" name="EA-IRB" dac_uid="56" dac_name="NHLBI" irb-approval-required="Yes"><Use-Restriction>Use of the Framingham data deposited in dbGaP is restricted to research on: genotype-phenotype associations; molecular phenotype (e.g., gene expression; microRNA)-phenotype associations; and proteomics/metabolomics-phenotype associations.  All other phenotype-only analyses are prohibited (note: investigators may request data for such phenotype-only analyses through NHLBI&#8217;s BioLINCC).  Additionally, the Framingham data may not be used to: 
o     Investigate individual pedigree structures or individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying individuals or families; or explore issues such as non-maternity or non-paternity.
o     Investigate topics that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or group.
o     Assess outcomes that are not related to health or disease conditions (note: methodological research that will serve as a prelude to health or disease research is permitted).

Data users are responsible for ensuring that all uses of the data are consistent with federal, state, and local laws and any relevant institutional policies, and that the data are always maintained in a secured fashion. Data users will be required to obtain IRB approval for their projects from their respective institutions (please note that only full or expedited approvals will be accepted). It is anticipated that, at least in some cases, the FHS data will be updated with additional information and will be so identified by an appropriate version number.

This FHS consent group allows for use of the data in health/medical/biomedical research.  Pre-release exchange area for use by study investigators only.
