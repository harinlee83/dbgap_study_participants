Use of the SHS and SHFS (hereafter designated as the SHS studies) aggregate genomic data is restricted to research on associations between phenotypes and genotypes. SHS studies data sets may not be used to investigate individual participant genotypes, individual pedigree structures, perceptions of racial/ethnic identity, non-maternity/paternity, and of variables that could be considered as stigmatizing to an individual or group. All research must be consistent with the SHS studies informed consent documents. All research must be related to the etiology and prevention of morbidity and mortality of the U.S. Population consistent with the demographic distribution in the PAGE Study.
Two factors create special considerations regarding data obtained from SHS and SHFS participants: 1) A special partnership exists between the SHS and SHFS and their respective tribes, each of them a sovereign nation. As a result, SHS investigators are not at liberty to make unilateral decisions regarding any aspect of the various studies without prior approval of the respective tribes. In actuality, this is true regardless of the sovereign nature of the tribes. The tribes, while granting authority to share data, have presently placed certain restrictions upon what they regard as perhaps unfettered distribution of certain data, particularly personalized data, even when the data are anonymized. As a result, the SHS and SHFS bear responsibilities towards their partners that are likely not shared by most other investigators. 2) Among many, if not most, Indian tribes, concepts of specimens and related data go beyond the usual concepts of &#8220;intellectual property&#8221; and ownership of data. There is a form of regard of such data that is not readily translatable, but for want of a more precise term may well be regarded as spiritual. Thus, Indian people generally treat such specimens and data as having personal implications that require that they be handled with proper respect, and they expect this attitude to be shared by investigators.</Use-Restriction></ConsentGroup><ConsentGroupLinks><ConsentGroupLink cg_uid_from="918"><StudyTo study_uid="37911" name="NHLBI Big Data Analysis Heart Failure Challenge Data Collection" accession="phs001991.v1"><ConsentGroupTo uid="3880" name="HMB"/></StudyTo></ConsentGroupLink></ConsentGroupLinks></Policy><SRA/><Documents/><Status uid="14" name="completed_by_gpa" title="Completed by GPA"/></Study><Study uid="8515" whole_study_id="8515" phs="000580" v="1" p="1" createDate="2012-08-16T14:12:10-05:00" modDate="2020-09-01T09:14:36-05:00" maxParentChildStudyModDate="2020-09-01T09:14:36-05:00" handle="CALiCo_SHS" num_participants=""><StudyInfo accession="phs000580.v1.p1" parentAccession="phs000580.v1.p1"><BioProject id="PRJNA185742" entrez_id="185742" type="bp_admin_access"/><BioProject id="PRJNA185743" entrez_id="185743" type="bp_data_submission"/><StudyNameEntrez>PAGE: CALiCo: Strong Heart Study (SHS)</StudyNameEntrez><StudyTypes2 calculated="Yes"><StudyType21 name="phenotype_data" chosen="No"/><StudyType21 name="analysis" chosen="Yes"/><StudyType21 name="individual_sequencing" chosen="No"/><StudyType21 name="supporting_documents" chosen="No"/><StudyType21 name="images" chosen="No"/><StudyType21 name="molecular" chosen="No"/><StudyType21 name="subject_samples" chosen="No"/><StudyType21 name="links_to_ncbi_dbs" chosen="No"/><StudyType21 name="other_general" chosen="No"/></StudyTypes2><StudyTypes><StudyType>analysis</StudyType></StudyTypes></StudyInfo><Authority><ICs><IC id="12" name="NHLBI" is_funding_ic="false" is_admin_ic="true"/><IC id="15" name="NHGRI" is_funding_ic="true" is_admin_ic="true" primary="true"/></ICs><Persons><Person nedid="KARI_NORTH" aid="2" auth="eRA" login="KARI_NORTH" fname="Kari" mname="E" lname="North" email="kari_north@unc.edu"><Role>PI</Role><Organization>UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL</Organization></Person><Person nedid="0013558953" aid="1" auth="cit" login="hindorffl" fname="Lucia" mname="A" lname="Hindorff" email="hindorffl@mail.nih.gov"><Role>PO</Role><Organization>NIH</Organization></Person><Person nedid="0013043239" aid="1" auth="cit" login="pretels" fname="Renate" mname="S" lname="Pretel" email="pretels@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"><Role>PHENO_CURATOR</Role><Organization>NIH</Organization></Person><Person nedid="0011552437" aid="1" auth="cit" login="jawang" fname="Zhen" mname="Yuan" lname="Wang" email="zhen.wang@nih.gov"><Role>GENO_CURATOR</Role><Organization>NIH</Organization></Person><Person nedid="0010170421" aid="1" auth="cit" login="strasbuj" fname="Jennifer" mname="A" lname="Strasburger" email="strasbuj@mail.nih.gov"><Role>GPA</Role><Organization>NIH</Organization></Person></Persons></Authority><Policy display-research-statement="true" display-public-summary="true" years-until-renewal="1" weeks-to-cancel-request="8" pub-embargo="none"><acknowledgement_statement>INSTRUCTIONS:  This study has not provided a suggested acknowledgement statement.
