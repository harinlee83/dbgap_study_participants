Acknowledgments and funding follow for the specific sub-studies within FOCI. 
GWAS Meta-Analysis: Funding Support for the Follow-up of Ovarian Cancer Genetic Association and Interaction Studies (FOCI) was provided through the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Cancer Post-GWAS Initiative, Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) (U19-CA148112). The genotyping, bioinformatics, and biostatistical analysis for MAY, NCO, and TOR were supported by R01-CA114343 and R01-CA114343-S1. The MAY study is supported by R01-CA122443, P50-CA136393, and funding from the Mayo Foundation. The NCO study is supported by R01-CA76016. The TBO study is supported by R01-CA106414, the American Cancer Society (CRTG-00-196-01-CCE), and the Advanced Cancer Detection Center Grant, Department of Defense (DAMD-17-98-1-8659).  The TOR study is supported by grants from the Canadian Cancer Society and the NIH (R01-CA63682 and R01-CA63678). The Mayo Clinic Genotyping Shared Resource is supported by the National Cancer Institute (P30-CA15083). The BWH study is supported by grants R01-CA54419 and P50-CA105009. The POL study was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and the Center for Cancer Research. The SEA study is funded by a program grant from Cancer Research UK. The UKO study is supported by funding from Cancer Research UK, the Eve Appeal, and the OAK Foundation; some of this work was undertaken at UCLH/UCL who received some funding from the Department of Health&#8217;s NIHR Biomedical Research Centre funding scheme. UK genotyping and data analysis were supported by a project grant from Cancer Research UK. UK studies also make use of data generated by the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium. A list of investigators who contributed to the generation of data is available at www.wtccc.org.uk.
