Use of the CHS data deposited in dbGaP is restricted to research on associations between phenotypes and genotypes.  CHS data may not be used to investigate individual pedigree structures or individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying individuals or families; assess variables or proxies that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or a group; perform phenotype-only analyses (note: investigators may request data for such phenotype-only analyses through the NHLBI&#8217;s BioLINCC); or explore issues such as non-maternity, non-paternity, and perceptions of racial/ethnic identity. All research must be related to the etiology and prevention of morbidity and mortality of the U.S. population consistent with the demographic distribution in CHS. CHS data may not be used to assess outcomes that are not related to health or disease conditions (note: methodological research that will serve as a prelude to health or disease research is permitted).

&lt;p&gt;The primary aim of the study is to conduct a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with   the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and heart failure (HF) among participants enrolled in the   Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) who were free of clinical cardiovascular disease at baseline. The secondary aim is to   conduct genome-wide association study of other phenotypes in CHS.  The study is an ancillary study to CHS.  CHS is a   population-based cohort study of risk factors for heart disease and stroke among older adults recruited at 4 US sites   in 1989-1990.  Subjects underwent an extensive baseline examination, and annual follow-up examinations through 1988-1999.&lt;/p&gt;
 </Description><StudyHistory>
&lt;p&gt;CHS is an NHLBI contract-funded cohort study designed to evaluate risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and   stroke in older adults.  The main objective is to identify factors related to the onset and course of heart disease   and stroke.  Subjects were recruited (as above) in 1989-90, and were followed with semi-annual contacts, alternating   between telephone calls and surveillance clinic visits through 1998-99.  During follow-up, 1990-1999, many baseline   examination components were repeated, and a few new ones were added.  The CHS clinic exams ended in June 1999.  After   June 1999, when the clinic exams ended, two phone calls per year to participants identified events and collected   limited information.&lt;/p&gt;
