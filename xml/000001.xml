&lt;p&gt;

   The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) was initially designed as a long-term multi-center, prospective study of the clinical

   course of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and age-related cataract. In addition to collecting natural history data, AREDS

   included a clinical trial of high-dose vitamin and mineral supplements for AMD and a clinical trial of high-dose vitamin supplements

   for cataract. AREDS participants were 55 to 80 years of age at enrollment and had to be free of any illness or condition that would make

   long-term follow-up or compliance with study medications unlikely or difficult. On the basis of fundus photographs graded by a

   central reading center, best-corrected visual acuity and ophthalmologic evaluations, 4,757 participants were enrolled in one of several

   AMD categories, including persons with no AMD.

  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;

   The clinical trials for AMD and cataract were conducted concurrently. AREDS participants were followed on the clinical trials for a

   median time of 6.5 years. Subsequent to the conclusion of the clinical trials, participants were followed for an additional 5 years

   and natural history data were collected. The AREDS research design is detailed in AREDS Report 1. AREDS Report 8 contains the mainline

   results from the AMD trial; AREDS Report 9 contains the results of the cataract trial.

  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;

   Blood samples were also collected from 3,700+ AREDS participants for genetic research. Genetic samples from 600 AREDS participants

   (200 controls, 200 Neovascular AMD cases, and 200 Geographic Atrophy cases) were selected using data available in March 2005 and then

   were evaluated with a genome-wide scan. These data, as well as selected phenotypic data, were made available in the dbGaP. DNA from

   AREDS participants, which is currently being stored in the AREDS Genetic Repository, is available for research purposes. However, not all

   of the 3,700+ AREDS participants who submitted a blood sample currently have DNA available.

  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;

   In addition to including the data from the genome-wide scan on the 600 original samples, this second version of the AREDS dbGaP

   database provides a comprehensive set of data tables with extensive clinical information collected for the 4,757 participants who

   participated in AREDS. The tables include information collected at enrollment/baseline, during study follow-up, fundus and lens pathology,

   nutritional estimates, quality of life measures and measures of morbidity and mortality.

  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;

   It is hoped that this resource will better help researchers understand two important diseases that affect an aging population. These data

   may be applied to examination and inference on genetic and genetic-environmental bases for age-related diseases of public health

   significance and may also help elucidate the clinical course of both conditions, generate hypotheses, and aid in the design of clinical

   trials of preventive interventions.

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;



  &lt;p&gt;

   &lt;b&gt;User&amp;#39;s Guide for AREDS Phenotype Data&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

   A detailed User&amp;#39;s Guide for the AREDS phenotype data is available.

   This &lt;a href="GetPdf.cgi?id=phd001552.1" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;User&amp;#39;s Guide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is meant to be

   a comprehensive document which explains the complexities of the AREDS data. &lt;i&gt;It is recommended that all researchers using AREDS

   phenotype data make use of this User&amp;#39;s Guide&lt;/i&gt;.
