Use of this data is limited to health/medical/biomedical purposes, does not include the study of population origins or ancestry. Requestor must provide documentation of local IRB approval. Use of the data includes methods development research (e.g., development of software or algorithms).

Use of the Framingham data deposited in dbGaP is restricted to research on: genotype-phenotype associations; molecular phenotype (e.g., gene expression; microRNA)-phenotype associations; and proteomics/metabolomics-phenotype associations.

Use of this data is limited to health/medical/biomedical purposes, does not include the study of population origins or ancestry. Requestor must provide documentation of local IRB approval. Use of the data includes methods development research (e.g., development of software or algorithms).

Use of the Framingham data deposited in dbGaP is restricted to research on: genotype-phenotype associations; molecular phenotype (e.g., gene expression; microRNA)-phenotype associations; and proteomics/metabolomics-phenotype associations. All other phenotype-only analyses are prohibited (note: investigators may request data for such phenotype-only analyses through NHLBI's BioLINCC). Additionally, the Framingham data may not be used to:
&#8226; Investigate individual pedigree structures or individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying individuals or families; or explore issues such as non-maternity or non-paternity. 
&#8226; Investigate topics that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or group. 
&#8226; Assess outcomes that are not related to health or disease conditions (note: methodological research that will serve as a prelude to health or disease research is permitted).

It is anticipated that, at least in some cases, the FHS data will be updated with additional information and will be so identified by an appropriate version number.

In addition, for HMB-IRB-NPU-MDS, use of the data is limited to not-for-profit organizations.</ic_specific_access_term><DUC><File uri="dbgapssws.cgi?blob_id=21744&amp;file=get&amp;page=file" filename="TOPMed FHS DUC 2016-10-06.rtf" md5="432459bde5865f436d53fd0a8af57f94" size="209452" modDate="2016-10-06T15:27:21-05:00" content-type="application/msword"/></DUC><DUC_PDF><File uri="dbgapssws.cgi?blob_id=21748&amp;file=get&amp;page=file" filename="TOPMed FHS DUC 2016-10-06.rtf.pdf" md5="86b99f072db38eaa8453d48ab75ec816" size="173143" modDate="2016-10-06T15:42:25-05:00" content-type="application/pdf"/></DUC_PDF><DUC_AcknowledgementStatement><File uri="dbgapssws.cgi?blob_id=21660&amp;file=get&amp;page=file" filename="1 Non-contract and Contract Phenotypic Dataset Acknowledgement 2016 09 30.pdf" md5="aec828935fec56d3ffef3c77c25e82cf" size="240976" modDate="2016-10-05T12:47:59-05:00" content-type="application/pdf"/></DUC_AcknowledgementStatement><ConsentGroup uid="1540" CGType="cg_class_HMB" title="Health/Medical/Biomedical (IRB, MDS)" name="HMB-IRB-MDS" dac_uid="56" dac_name="NHLBI" irb-approval-required="Yes"><Use-Restriction>Use of this data is limited to health/medical/biomedical purposes, does not include the study of population origins or ancestry.
