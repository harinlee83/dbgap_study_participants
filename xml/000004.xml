&lt;p&gt;The NINDS repository &lt;a href="http://ccr.coriell.org/ninds"&gt;(http://ccr.coriell.org/ninds/)&lt;/a&gt; was established in October 2001 with the goal
of developing standardized, broadly useful diagnostic and other clinical data, as well as a collection of DNA and cell line samples to
further advance gene discovery of neurological disorders. All samples and both phenotypic and genotypic data are available to the research
community including academic and industry scientists.  A set of samples from individuals who do not have neurological disease was felt
to be essential to allow gene discovery in neurological disorders to proceed.  Towards this goal, the NINDS has and is collecting samples
and phenotypic data on neurologically normal individuals.  The data being collected includes demographic, ethnic, and exclusion of
neurological disease information.  Variables were measured using the
&lt;a href="javascript:getPage(&amp;#39;document.cgi&amp;#39;, 43);"&gt;Control Clinical Data Elements form&lt;/a&gt;.
As of June 2007, there are a total of 2157 publicly available and an additional &gt;2000 which will be added to the publicly available
biomaterials collection shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood samples were drawn from neurologically normal, unrelated, individuals at many different sites.  Spouses, convenience controls,
and population controls were all included in this collection.  Each participant underwent a detailed medical history interview and had
no family history on specific query of Alzheimer&amp;#39;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia, autism, bipolar disorder, brain aneurysm,
dementia, dystonia, or Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease.  Folstein Mini-mental state examination scores ranged from 26-30 and are available on a subset
of individuals.  All participants were interviewed for family history in detail and specifically had no first degree relative with any
of the following: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ataxia, autism, brain aneurysm, dystonia, Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease, and schizophrenia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A subset of neurologically normal control subjects was utilized in &lt;a href="./study.cgi?id=phs000089"&gt;NINDS Parkinson&amp;#39;s Disease&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href="./study.cgi?id=phs000101"&gt;NINDS Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Controls&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="./study.cgi?id=phs000102"&gt;NINDS 
Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
