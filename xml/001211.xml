Use of the ARIC Study data deposited in dbGaP is restricted to research on associations between phenotypes and genotypes. ARIC data may not be used to investigate individual pedigree structures or individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying individuals or families; assess variables or proxies that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or a group; perform phenotype-only analyses (note: investigators may request data for such phenotype-only analyses through NHLBI&#8217;s BioLINCC); or explore issues such as non-maternity, non-paternity, and perceptions of racial/ethnic identity. Data users will be required to obtain IRB approval for their projects from their respective institutions (please note that only full or expedited approvals will be accepted). One consent group is available for the ARIC Study: health/medical/biomedical research. 
This Data Use Certification will be reviewed and approved by the NHLBI Data Access Committee.
