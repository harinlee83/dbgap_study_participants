</acknowledgement_statement><ic_specific_access_term>There are multiple consent groups for CAAPA, corresponding to the consents in the component studies: 1) General Research Use with IRB, 2) Lung Disease, 3) Health/Medical/Biomedical, 4) Health/Medical/Biomedical with IRB, 5) Health/Medical/Biomedical with IRB for non-profit institutions only, 6) Focused Disease Only with IRB and 7) Focused Disease Only with IRB for non-profit institutions only. 

For the Lung Disease group (#2 above): Informed consent restrict the use of data analysis related to lung diseases including asthma/allergies (immunologic disease), asthma related traits(e.g., obesity), drug response, genetic ancestry to adjust for differences between cases and controls and to identify new genes related to clinical phenotypes.

The Focused Disease Groups  (#6&amp;7 above) allow for study of blood pressure, heart or other cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, or lung disease and risk factors for these diseases only. Use of these data to study other diseases (e.g. cancer, schizophrenia) is NOT allowed under the current consent.

For the consent groups requiring IRB documentation (#1 and #4-7), please note that only full or expedited approvals will be accepted.

For groups #4-7, these data may not be used to investigate individual pedigree structures or individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying individuals or families; assess variables or proxies that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or a group; perform phenotype-only analyses (note: investigators may request data for such phenotype-only analyses through NHLBI&#8217;s BioLINCC); or explore issues such as non-maternity and non-paternity.
