Use of the CHS data deposited in dbGaP is restricted to research on associations between phenotypes and genotypes.  CHS data may not be used to investigate individual pedigree structures or individual participant genotypes for the purpose of identifying individuals or families; assess variables or proxies that could be considered as stigmatizing an individual or a group; perform phenotype-only analyses (note: investigators may request data for such phenotype-only analyses through the NHLBI&#8217;s BioLINCC); or explore issues such as non-maternity, non-paternity, and perceptions of racial/ethnic identity.
