Data users will be required to obtain IRB approval for their projects from their respective institutions. Only full or expedited approvals are acceptable, and an ANNUAL IRB review is required base on the informed consents from the submitting institution. 

There are four consent groups for JHS: 1) Health/Medical/Biomedical; 2) Non-profit Health/Medical/Biomedical; 3) Focus Diseases only, limiting analysis to the study of blood pressure, heart or other cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, or lung disease and risk factors for these diseases only; and 4) Non-profit Focus Diseases only.
