&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is a study of risk factors for development and progression of CHD and stroke in   people aged 65 years and older. The objectives of the Cardiovascular Health Study are to: 1) quantify associations of   conventional and hypothesized risk factors with CHD and stroke; 2) assess the associations of non-invasive measures of   subclinical disease with the incidence of CHD and stroke; 3) quantify the associations of risk factors with subclinical   disease; 4) characterize the natural history of CHD and stroke, and identify factors associated with clinical course;   and 5) describe the prevalence and distributions of risk factors, non-invasive measures of subclinical disease, and   clinical CHD and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study originated in 1988 from the recommendations of an NHLBI workshop on the management of CHD in the elderly.   This is the most extensive study undertaken by the NHLBI to study CVD exclusively in an elderly population. Initially   funded for six years, it was renewed for a second six year period in 1994 and recently was renewed for continued   morbidity and mortality follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subjects:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The 5,888 study participants were recruited from four U.S. communities and have undergone extensive clinic examinations   for evaluation of markers of subclinical cardiovascular disease. The original cohort totaled 5,201 participants. A new   cohort was recruited in 1992. The 687 participants in the new cohort are predominately African-American and were   recruited at three of the four field centers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The 2,962 women and 2,239 men were examined yearly from 1989 through 1999. The added minority cohort of 256 men   and 431 women was examined from 1992 to 1999. Examination components have included medical history questionnaires,   measurement of ankle-brachial index, abdominal and carotid ultrasound studies, echocardiograms, ambulatory   electrocardiograms, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging, spirometry and retinal photographs over the past decade.   The most extensive evaluations were at study entry (baseline) and again in 1992-1993 to assess change in subclinical   disease measures. CHS has undertaken extensive follow-up for ascertainment of cardiovascular events including incident   claudication, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke and death.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NHLBI Candidate-gene Association Resource.&lt;/b&gt; The NHLBI initiated the Candidate gene Association Resource (CARe) to create a shared genotype/phenotype resource for analyses of the association of genotypes with phenotypes relevant to the mission of the NHLBI. The resource comprises nine cohort studies funded by the NHLBI including: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC), Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), Cleveland Family Study (CFS), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). A database of genotype and phenotype data was created that includes records for approximately 41,000 study participants with approximately 50,000 SNPs from more than 2,000 selected candidate genes. In addition, a genome wide association study using a 1,000K SNP Chip was conducted on approximately 8,900 African American participants drawn from five CARe cohorts: ARIC, CARDIA, CFS, JHS, and MESA. Data from individual cohorts is available to approved investigators through dbGaP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some relevant CARe publications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   CARe Study: PMID &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20400780" target="_blank"&gt;20400780&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   CVD Chip Design: PMID &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18974833" target="_blank"&gt;18974833&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
 </Description><StudyHistory>
&lt;p&gt;The mean age at baseline was 72 years, 58% women, 16% Black, 31% had CVD. Participants were contacted twice per year, with   phone follow-up alternating with clinic visits through 1999, and phone follow-up continuing through the present time.  Clinic   exams included medical and personal history, medication inventory, ECG, blood pressure, and assessment of physical and cognitive   function, depression.  Other components done less frequently included phlebotomy, spirometry, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound,   cranial MR, and retinal exam, Cardiovascular events were adjudicated by a committee.  The phone follow-up was done primarily for   events ascertainment, but also included questions on independence of function.&lt;/p&gt;
