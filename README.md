# dbgap_study_participants

- The **xmlParser.py** will parse the **phs** and **num_participants** field from each of the files in the **xml folder** and write the results in **phsNumParticipants.csv**
- Note: Some files had empty strings for the num_participants field and others had no num_participants field name in which case "Not Found" was inserted into the csv.
